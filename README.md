### Dataset
- [ deprecated ] Konect Datasets: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/.
#### SNAP Datasets. *Stanford Large Network Data Collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.
1. Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
2. Networks with ground-truth communities : ground-truth network communities in social and information networks
3. Communication networks : email communication networks with edges representing communication
4. Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
5. Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
6. Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
7. Amazon networks : nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
8. Internet networks : nodes represent computers and edges communication
9. Road networks : nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
10. Autonomous systems : graphs of the internet
11. Signed networks : networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
12. Location-based online social networks : social networks with geographic check-ins
13. Wikipedia networks, articles, and metadata : talk, editing, voting, and article data from Wikipedia
14. Temporal networks : networks where edges have timestamps
15. Twitter and Memetracker : memetracker phrases, links and 467 million Tweets
16. Online communities : data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr
17. Online reviews : data from online review systems such as BeerAdvocate and Amazon
18. User actions : actions of users on social platforms.
19. Face-to-face communication networks : networks of face-to-face (non-online) interactions
20. Graph classification datasets : disjoint graphs from different classes
21. Computer communication networks : communications among computers running distributed applications
22. Cryptocurrency transactions : transactions covering several cryptocurrencies and exchanges
23. Telecom networks : relationships between users, packages, apps, and cells in a telecom network
